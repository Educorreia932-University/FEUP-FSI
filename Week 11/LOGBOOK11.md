> What part of the certificate indicates this is a CAâ€™s certificate?

Because of the issuer.

> What part of the certificate indicates this is a self-signed certificate?

The issuer and the subject are the same.

> In the RSA algorithm, we have a public exponent e, a private exponent d, a modulus n, and two secret numbers p and q, such that n = pq. Please identify the values for these elements in your certificate and key files.

*e* - `publicExponent`  
*p* - `privateExponent`  
*n* - `modulus`  
*p* - `prime1`  
*q* - `prime2`
